This file documents additions and changes to files and templates related to
Parley's i18n.

The inention is for 'en' to be the main/key language for the application with
other translations being made from it.  As a consequence of this, i-default
will be used as the 'en' i18n file.
It's unlikely that we'll need an 'en' file in the project.
